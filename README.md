# ðŸ“Š Deloitte Virtual Internship Project â€“ Excel Dashboards

Welcome to my Deloitte Data Analysis Virtual Internship project completed via **Forage**. This project involved analyzing datasets and building interactive dashboards in **Microsoft Excel** to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.
## ðŸ§  Overview

I completed **two real-world tasks** during this internship, simulating business scenarios that involved data analysis, visualization, and reporting using Excel.

## ðŸ§© Task 1: Machine Downtime Dashboard

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To create an Excel dashboard that counts and visualizes the **number of machine downtimes** based on telemetry data collected from different factories and locations.

### ðŸ”§ What I Did
- Cleaned raw telemetry data.
- Used **Pivot Tables** to count downtime events (`Status = "Down"`).
- Analyzed downtime frequency by **factory**, **location**, and **device**.
- Created an **interactive dashboard** with charts and filters.

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Factory A** had the highest number of downtimes.
- **Device Type X** showed frequent issues during night hours.
- Patterns showed that downtimes peaked during specific date ranges.

## ðŸ§© Task 2: Gender Pay Fairness Analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze salary data across genders and build an Excel dashboard to evaluate whether the **salaries are distributed fairly** between male and female employees.

### ðŸ”§ What I Did
- Imported and cleaned employee salary data.
  - **Average salary by gender**
  - **Salary distribution by department and job level**
- Highlighted salary gaps (if any) using visual indicators

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- In some departments, **males had a slightly higher average salary** than females.
- Other areas showed **near-equal pay**, indicating fairness.
- The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor and act on gender pay fairness.
